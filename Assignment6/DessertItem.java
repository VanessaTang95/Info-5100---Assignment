/*
The DessertItem class is an abstract superclass from which specific types of DessertItems can be derived.
It contains only one data member, a name. It also defines a number of methods.
All of the DessertItem class methods except the getCost() method are defined in a generic way in the file Class-DessertItem, 
provided for you along with the other homework specific files in the directory.
The getCost() method is an abstract method that is not defined in the DessertItem class because the method of determining the costs varies based on the type of item.
Tax amounts should be rounded to the nearest cent. 
For example, the calculating the tax on a food item with a cost of 199 cents with a tax rate of 2.0% should be 4 cents. 
The complete specifications for the DessertItem class are provided in the file Class-DessertItem.
